pyproxystats
============

A python script to collect statistics about different proxies you might use in order to choose one.

It is based on urllib2 for http/s proxies and [SocksiPy](http://socksipy.sourceforge.net/) (with a little patch) for socks4/5 proxies.

The script is functional but very basic. In order to use it, run 

    python proxy_checker.py -h
